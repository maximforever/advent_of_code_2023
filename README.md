# Advent of Code 2023

This year, I'm attempting Advent of Code in JS/TS, which is the language I'm most comfortable with. In past years, I tried to both improve other languages and solve hard problems and write clean code. I got stuck around days 5-7.

This year, my goal is to solve the problems. I'll be focusing on that first and foremost. I'll add notes here as I go.
